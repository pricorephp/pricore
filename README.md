## About Pricore

Pricore is an open-source private Composer registry designed to help teams securely manage and distribute their PHP
packages.
It provides a centralized, reliable way to store package metadata, control access with tokens, and integrate seamlessly
with Git-based workflows. With Pricore, teams gain full ownership of their package ecosystem while keeping dependency
management fast, consistent and transparent.
